## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction  
The bear data collected by  *Provincia di Trento* are stored in a spatial relational database based on the software platform PostgreSQL/PostGIS. The database is hosted at Mach Foundation (Italy). All the information in the database is checked, structured, standardized and coded (whenever possible) to facilitate data use and sharing.   
The database is designed to (potentially) store also data from different groups, **if** this will be a requirement in the future. In this case some additional work will be needed to harmonize datasets form different sources (and potentially adapt/extend the database data model), particularly for non-tracking data.   
Users can connect to the database to visualize/analyze/manage/modify the data using remote client applications (if they have an account with the permission to do so) with no data replication (i.e. no potential inconsistencies generated by multiple versions of the same data set). Accesses to the database by several users at the same time are managed by the server. Appropriate mechanisms and rules are set up inside the database to grant data consistency. 

In this document, users can find the basic information to understand the data content and to connect to and use the database.   
If you want to know more about the advantages of database to store and manage wildlife biologging (but not only) data, give a read to the paper [Wildlife tracking data management: a new vision](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1550/2177) and the book [Spatial Database for GPS Wildlife Tracking Data](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319037424).

This document is not a guide to SQL, which is needed if you want to do more than just download or visualize tables. If you want to learn more about SQL, (the standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in relational databases), you can look on the web for one of the many free tutorial/courses.   

If project partners need to format/combine data in a specific way and do not have the SQL knowledge to do it, we can support, just send an email to one of the project coordinators with the details of what you want.

## <a name="connectionparameters"></a> Connection parameters  
The database can be accessed using the following parameters:

	  IP or Domain name of the server: eurodeer2.fmach.it
	  Server Port: 5432
	  Name of the Database: bear_db
	  User Name: ...
	  Password: ...


If you don't have a user account (and you are entitle to have you) please contact Francesca Cagnacci or Luca Pedrotti or Ferdinando Urbano.

Each client software has a different interface to PostgreSQL/PostGIS. For some examples see section [Client tools](#clienttools).

## <a name="datacontent"></a> Data content  
**Individual-based Relational Spatial Database**, the main set of data stored into the database are those generated by telemetry sensors to monitor bears movement ("**Spatial**") and by genetic sampling ("**Individual-based**"), particularly: 

* GPS Tracking data
* Genetic data

The two datasets are associated to additional information about the animals ("**Relational**") concerning life-history traits such as kinship, damages, sighting, and tracks. Data are organized in a set of related tables. The core table is the list of monitored animals with their key attributes (table main.animals).

## <a name="datastructure"></a> Data structure  
A database contains one or more named [schemas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-schemas.html), which in turn contain tables. Schemas also contain other kinds of named objects, including data types, functions, and operators.  
Schema are used to organize database objects into logical groups, to make them more manageable, and to allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other. Schemas are similar to folders in a file system.

The schemas in the bear_db at the moment are:

* **main**: This schema is the place where all the core information related to the main objects involved in bear monitoring are stored: animals, genetics, data from sensors, sensors, deployments, research groups. The data are are visible through **Views**.
* **env_data**: This schema hosts all the environmental used to enhance location data (DEM, slope, aspect, Corine land cover [not yet available], NDVI Modis [not yet available], snow Modis [not yet available].	
* **lu_tables**: This schema is where the look up tables are stored. These tables are the list and the description of codes referenced by other tables in the database and are a kind of valid domains for specific fields.	
* **tools**: This schema hosts all the functions and tools that are used throughout the database to manage, massage, analyse and query data.
* **data_trentino**: This schema is used to store the original data provided by Trentino (Italy) and is accessible by users from this research group only.
* **public**: Standard public schema used by the system. No information on bears is stored here.


### <a name="schemamain"></a> SCHEMA MAIN.VIEWS

#### VIEWS
A view is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object. This pre-established query command is kept in the database dictionary. Unlike ordinary base tables in a relational database, a view does not form part of the physical schema: as a result set, it is a virtual table computed or collated dynamically from data in the database when access to that view is requested. Changes applied to the data in a relevant underlying table are reflected in the data shown in subsequent invocations of the view.  

The users can thus access the following data through **views** in the schema **main**:

1. [view_shared_animals](#view_shared_animals)
2. [view_shared_animals_genotypes](#view_shared_animals_genotypes)
3. [view_shared_animals_parents](#view_shared_animals_parents)
4. [view_shared_convexhull](#view_shared_convexhull)
5. [view_shared_cubs](#view_shared_cubs)
6. [view_shared_cubs_split](#view_shared_cubs_split)
7. [view_shared_identification](#view_shared_identification)
8. [view_shared_tracking_data](#view_shared_tracking_data)
9. [view_shared_trajectories](#view_shared_trajectories)

## <a name="clienttools"></a> Client tools
While data are (safely and consistently) stored in the database, users can use client applications to access the data. Data are not duplicated but a single, controlled version is available to all users. According to the task that must be performed (including a plain export to .csv for they who are allergic to databases), users can use one of the many clients available. For tabual data visualization, query, download, the recommended tools are PgAdmin (3 or 4) or PhpPgAdmin. For visualization and processing of spatial data, QGIS is the best client. For statistical analysis, R is the most used tool. LibreOffice offers a complete suite of products to interact with the database.  
Data can also be imported in the specific software, and processed independently from the version in the database, although this means that a new "version" of the data is created with consequent problem or synchronization (if the dataset is updated).

If you need technical support, please contact the project or the database manager.

All these tools are open source, standard compliant, efective and well documented. It is also possible to access the data using proprietary software like ArcGIS, Office, SAS. In this case, interested users can look for tutorial on how connect these tools to the database.


### phppgAdmin
The data in the database can be accessed, explored, queried and downloaded (as csv) using a web based tool available at [http://eurodeer2.fmach.it/phppgadmin/](http://eurodeer2.fmach.it/phppgadmin/). There is no need to install any software on the local computer. The interface is very intuitive and similar to PgAdmin, with a structure pretty similar to a file system explorer. This is the recommended interface for basic users. It is not possible to visualize spatial data. For an example, see the figure below.

![](https://github.com/feurbano/bear_data/blob/master/phppgadmin.png)


### PgAdmin
[PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is the most popular and feature rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL. There are two versions: 3 and 4 (the former is more intuitive, the latter more modern and powerful). This is the best tool to manage the data and explore both structure and content, including the formulation of advanced queries and the creation of new database objects.
Here below and example of the window with the connection parameters.

![](https://github.com/feurbano/bear_data/blob/master/pgadmin.png)


### QGIS
[QGIS](www.qgis.org) is a desktop GIS that is very well integrated with PostgreSQL and PostGIS and offers a large set of tools to deal with spatial data in the database. Connecting to the database is pretty simple and weel documented, for example [here](http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/training_manual/databases/index.html). Data can be accessed in three steps: create a connection to the db. Open the connection. Get the data. Here below is reported as an example a screenshot of the connection window in QGIS.

![](https://github.com/feurbano/bear_data/blob/master/qgis1.png)

![](https://github.com/feurbano/bear_data/blob/master/qgis2.png)


### R
You can easily import data from the database into [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using a code like the one reported below:

	library(RPostgreSQL)
	drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
	con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname="bear_db", host="eurodeer2.fmach.it", port="5432", user="YOURUSER", password="YOURPASSWORD")
	rs <- dbSendQuery(con, "select * from main.view_shared_animals")
	df <- fetch(rs,-1)
	df[1:4,]
	str(df)
	dbClearResult(rs)
  
In the *dbSendQuery* command, you can include any SQL code.

Note that in the database is activated [Pl/R](http://www.joeconway.com/plr.html), a tool that permits to embed R code into SQL. 


### LibreOffice
Base and Calc are two tools of the suite [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) that allow the connection with the database and offer the possibility to create queries with graphical tools, build masks, edit the data in a user-friendly environment and visualize the information as spreadsheet.
More information on how to connect with PostrgeSQL can be found in the LibreOffice documentation.


## <a name="femcluster"></a> Other database in the FEM DB cluster
A PostgreSQL database cluster contains one or more named databases. In this case, **bear_db** is hosed in the same server used by the euroungulates project (eurodeer, eureddeer and euroboar database). Users and groups of users are shared across the entire cluster, but no other data is shared across databases. Any given client connection to the server can access only the data in a single database, the one specified in the connection request.

Users of a cluster do not necessarily have the privilege to access every database in the cluster. This means that user of euroungulates do not have access to bear_db and bear_db users cannot access euroungulates databases.
